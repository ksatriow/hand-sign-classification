### Implementation
* The dataset I use is around 40000 images.
* The dataset is divided into 80% train set and 20% test set.
* Using a sequential model.
* Using Conv2D Maxpooling Layer.
* Accuracy in training and validation set above 95%.
* Using Callbacks.
* Use a plot against the accuracy and loss of the model.
* Save the model into TF-Lite format.


## Steps
1. Install the modules required based on the type of implementation.
2. Download the dataset you want to train and predict your system with 
3. Train your data using Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/)
